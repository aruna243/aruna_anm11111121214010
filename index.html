    </p>
    <p>
        A day in the life of a software developer includes using models and diagrams to design software based on user needs and client specifications. Software developers write code using programming languages, build software components, and test their designs. As a part of software testing, developers address issues or errors. After deploying an application, software developers perform maintenance, updates, and upgrades as needed.

Software developers may collaborate with coders, software engineers, graphic designers, and other colleagues to create applications. A day in the life of a software developer may also include independent work.
